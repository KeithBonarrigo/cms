<h3 class="one_fourth animate fadeInUp">What happens if you default on your loans</h3>
<p class="fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">Federally backed student loans are considered in default status after 270 days of consecutive non-payment. At that point, the Department of Education typically hands off the account to a debt collector. The Department. of Education contracts with 23 private companies that collect defaulted student loans. Once your loans are defaulted, a few things will happen. First, you lose the ability to enter into a repayment plan (discussed above) and you cannot request forebearance or deferment. Second, the Department of Education also reports student loans to the credit bureaus, so your loans will likely be reported as in default status. Third, once loans are in default status and placed with a collection agency, the Department of Education can add a collection fee of up to 25% of the principal, interest, and fees already due and owing. On top of that, the collection agency can charge a commission of 25% or more. Lastly, federally backed student loans can be collected through the use of income tax refund captures and administrative wage garnishment of up to 15% of your wages. Borrowers will get notice before either occurs, but a judgment is not required for either step.
